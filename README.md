INSTALLATION:
1. Download java installer jdk-18.0.2.1_windows-x64_bin.exe
2. Put it into the BreakTheFake folder
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

RUN:
1. python maingui.py
2. Insert a link
3. Click "CHEKER" (yes, it is misspelled)

HOW PROGRAM WORKS:
1. Gets the topic of the website
2. Finds similar articles out in the internet
3. Checks if the date of those articles is similar.
4. Compares text contents for info intersection. I have no idea how it works, but our megamind @Kr1us somehow did it))
5. Gives the report in percentage of fake likeliness.
