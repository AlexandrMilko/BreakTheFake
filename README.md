# BreakTheFake
Automated check if an article is a fake one or not.
There are lots of work to do further, but it still works for some articles.

This project was done by my friends and me on HackYeah 2022 in 24hours. OUR TEAM:
- David
- @akrzeszewska
- @shurikandrew
- @mkdir28
- @Kr1us
- @AlexandrMilko

INSTALLATION:
1. Install jdk-18.0.2.1
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

RUN:
1. python maingui.py
2. Insert a link
3. Click "CHEKER" (yes, it is misspelled)

HOW PROGRAM WORKS:
1. Gets the topic of the website
2. Finds similar articles out in the internet
3. Checks if the date of those articles is similar.
4. Compares text contents for info intersection. I have no idea how it works, but our megamind @Kr1us somehow did it))
5. Gives the report in percentage of fake likeliness.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE ALSO:
- automated cookies accepting, because some websites did not allow us to parse before that.
- made an excellent website for it. Check it in WebSite directory.
- webapp template.
- an outstanding presentation
